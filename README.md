## Progress Tracker


## Problem Statement

Dungeon Masters (DMs) uses information within a game manual to construct their game world for players to explore in. The game manual is a large document of 400+ pages as this makes it tedious for them to look for relevant information.

## Solution

A question & answer chatbot that uses retrieval augmentation generation (RAG) together with a Large Language Model (LLM). With the game manual as knowledge base, the chatbot will be able to help DMs find information quickly
